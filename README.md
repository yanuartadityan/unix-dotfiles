## Overview

Collection of [dotfiles](https://se-education.org/learningresources/contents/dotfiles/Dotfiles.html#:~:text=Conclusion-,What%20are%20Dotfiles%3F,termination%20and%20everything%20in%20between.) that I personally used in my development setup. Not the best and prettiest dotfiles out there, but I do not want to spend hours just to have 'perfect' setup for my environment. This repo along with its `INSTALL.sh` script allows me to quickly copy a setup from my local Ubuntu environment to others, including Macos or other Linux distros, which so far I only add RedHat (Fedora based) and Arch.

Lot of [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) clips being watched, can't mentioned one by one.
